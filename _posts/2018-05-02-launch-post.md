Today is the official launch of _No Mud Huts: An Open Anthropological Journal About Kenya's Tech Industry_!

I created this site as a part of MSU anthropology department's [Cultural Heritage Informatics Fellowship](http://chi.anthropology.msu.edu){:target="_blank"}. Using this website I intend to contribute to the open science research movement as a part of my broader support for an open access approach to scientific publication.

I am about to complete my comprehensive exams and will shortly be moving to Kenya to undergo a year-long data collection period, during which time I will be writing about my research on this site. Because of limitations regarding participant confidentiality, I will _not_ be publishing all of my field notes and collected data, as would normally be expected of a scientist contributing to the open science movement. Instead, I will be working to write preliminary analyses of those notes and data, in order to strike a balance the ethics of conducting anthropological research with the ethics of ensuring one's scientific production is accessible to as large an audience as possible1.

I hope that this site will help to shine light on the processes involved in "doing anthropology" for those who are interested. It is my hope that this site is viewed favorably and intently by those professionals with whom I am honored to conduct research in Kenya, but others who may be interested in what exactly it is anthropologists do and how at least one of us thinks.

## Basic Site Overview

Despite being hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com){:target="_blank"}, which only allows static websites, _No Mud Huts_ integrates a few open-source tools to allow for quick design changes and an automated comments section complete with Gravatar integration. Comments can be easily disabled for individual posts as well. As the blog grows, the theme I've used for building the website's design has an option to quickly implement post categorizations for blog post lists, as well as generate suggested posts as links between posts.
