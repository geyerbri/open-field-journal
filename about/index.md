<img class="left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/geyer-profile.jpg" width="50%" />Hello! I am an anthropology PhD student at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu) where I split my time between my academic duties and working to teach digital technology skills to undergraduate students in social science and humanities courses. For the latter focus, I have been working as a research assistant in [LEADR](http://leadr.msu.edu), a digital technology pedagogy lab in the departments of History and Anthropology, for the past four years. For the former, my research seeks to critically interrogate how different identities of Kenya's tech professionals might influence an individual's access to or success within the industry, especially when those identities are considered intersectionally. Additionally, I want to understand how the collective identities of tech professionals influences the relationships between that industry and others in Kenya, the tech industry in the United states, and Kenya's governmental institutions.

Prior to pursuing my graduate studies I earned B.A.s in music and in anthropology at [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu). Upon completing my studies there, I joined the U.S. Peace Corps and served two years as a public health volunteer in Kenya, where I began to learn first-hand about international development. For those two years I lived in a rural community on the edge of the Maasai Mara National Reserve, where I am known as Lemayian Ole Ting'isha. Though during my service I focused upon learning how to speak Maa, I began to develop an ear for understanding Kiswahili as well. Since completing my service and enrolling at MSU I have further progressed in my ability to write and speak in Kiswahili.

## About the project

Using this website I intend to contribute to the open science research movement. I am about to complete my comprehensive exams and will shortly be moving to Kenya to undergo a year-long data collection period. Because of limitations regarding participant confidentiality, I will _not_ be publishing all of my field notes and collected data, but instead will be working to write preliminary analyses of those notes and data. I hope that this site will help to shine light on the processes involved in "doing anthropology" for those who are interested. It is my hope that this site is viewed favorably and intently by those professionals with whom I am honored to conduct research in Kenya, but others who may be interested in what exactly it is anthropologists do and how we - some of us, at least - think.
